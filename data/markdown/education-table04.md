| 31 | 1) Figures for 2011/12 onwards are not directly comparable to earlier years as a Single Individualised Learner Record (ILR) data collection system has been introduced. Small technical changes have been made in the way learners from more than one provision type are counted, leading to a removal of duplicate learners and a reduction in overall learner numbers of approximately 2 per cent. More information on the Single ILR is available at: |                                                         |                 |           |           |                         |           |                         |           |                         |

| 33 | 2) Figures between 2007/08 and 2010/11 were revised in June 2012. This was due to a methodological change in how learners are counted for English, maths and ESOL courses to remove duplicate learners. Total learner figures are not affected.
