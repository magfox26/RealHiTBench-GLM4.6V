| 36 | 3 Prior to 2011/12, no distinction was made between First responder and Co-responder medical incidents. From 2011/12, these could be recorded separately for the first time.                                     |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |                       |                       |    |                     |    |    |    |    |
| 37 | As such care should be taken when assessing the categorisation of medical incidents during 2011/12 as services became accustomed to recording Co-responder incidents separately.                                 |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |         |                       |                       |    |                     |    |    |    |    |
