1Includes various types of cherries like Bing and Rainer. USDA, Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) reports that inedible pits and stems account for 8 percent of the fruit's weight, implying a preparation yield of 92 percent, when the fruit is eaten raw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         &                            &                               &                                              &                           &                            &                                                      \\
2Excludes Maraschino cherries, pie and pastry filling, and cherries with pits. The syrup (or water) is discarded prior to consumption. Based on USDA, ARS’ Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED), USDA, ERS assumes that 65 percent of the can's gross weight is solid and 35 percent is syrup or water. The FPED cup-equivalent weight for canned fruit is the weight of the solids and not of the liquid medium in which it is packed. The preparation yield factor for canned cherries in the above table does not account for any further preparation that occurs prior to consumption. &                            &                               &                                              &                           &                            &                                                      \\
