1It is assumed that avocados are consumed raw. According to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service’s (ARS) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), inedible skin and seed account for about 26 percent of the weight of a raw avocado, implying a preparation yield of about 74 percent.                                                             &                            &                               &                                              &                           &                            &                                                      \\
