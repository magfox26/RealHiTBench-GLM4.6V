"(1) The distinction between full- and part-time workers is based on hours usually worked.  These data do not sum to totals because full- or part-time status on the principal job is not identifiable for a small number of multiple jobholders.","","","","",""
"Note: See the technical notes section for information about the federal minimum wage level and estimating the number of minimum wage workers. Estimates for the race groups shown (White, Black or African American, and Asian) do not sum to totals because data are not presented for all race groups. People of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity may be of any race; estimates for the race groups include Hispanics.
