"About","This excel contains the 2020 update of the results from the 2017 State of Narragansett Bay and Its Watershed Technical Report (nbep.org), Chapter 13: ""Benthic Habitat."" Sites in Narragansett Bay were monitored across 1988, 2008, and 2018 for benthic habitat type and changes in benthic habitat quality via a sediment profile imaging survey. The results from this survey were published by Shumchenia and King (2019). ","","","","",""

"biotope88","Biotope classification for 1988. Each sediment profile image was first assigned to a sediment grain size category, then biota were described from the biotic surface and subsurface features. These elements were summarized into a short phrase using the sediment grain size descriptor and dominant biota. Non-dominant but conspicuous biota were included in the descriptions when present. More detailed biota and sediment descriptions and the designated biotope for each SPI image replicate are presented in Shumchenia and King (2019). [AM: Ampelisca beds occasionally with other small tube-building and shallowburrowing fauna on substrates ranging from organic-rich muds to sand. Beggiatoa spp. or Mulinia lateralis may be present; SA: Hard sands with epibenthic sponges, rafting or attached macroalgae, and/or mobile gastropods; SH.SA: Very coarse sands with shell hash. Rafting macroalgae or Crepidula beds may be present; SH.SI: Crepidula bed on mud. Mobile crustaceans, gastropods, or Beggiatoa spp. may be presen; UN.SF: Organic-rich mud with tolerant species such as Beggiatoa spp., tube-building polychaetes, and shallow burrowing fauna; UN.SH: Burrowing fauna on mud with shell hash. Tube-building polychaetes or deep burrowing fauna may be present; UN.SI: Burrowing fauna on mud. Tubebuilding polychaetes, larger tubebuilders such as Chaetopterus, or deep burrowing fauna may be present; UN.SS: Burrowing and tube-building fauna on sandy mud; UN.ST: Small tube-building fauna on mud or organic-rich mud. Larger tube builders, such as Chaetopterus, and shallow or deep-burrowing fauna may be present.; NA: Station not sampled and/or no images obtained from station and/or images missing from the archive, preventing reanalysis; indet: Images were collected but not interpretable for biotope classification.)","","","","",""

"stage88","Infaunal successional stage provides an additional way to characterize benthic communities, and can be used as a modifying metric to accompany benthic biotope descriptors. Successional stage designation relies on the assumption that in fine-grained benthic biotopes a predictable 4-stage sequence of benthic community types develops following disturbance (e.g., hypoxia/anoxia, dredging, etc.). Successional stage was assigned for each 1988 image based on the organism-sediment relationships visible in each image. (0 = Stage 0: Immediately following disturbance; no macrofauna visible; if oxygen and/or organic enrichment are major stressors, black reduced sediment will be visible at sediment-water interface; 1 = Stage 1: Characterized by “pioneer” species such as very small polychaetes, usually densely populated at or near the sediment-water interface; 2 = Stage 2: Ampelisca is a hallmark organism of this stage in Northeast US coastal systems; burrowing organisms are also present; 3 = Stage 3: Considered a mature benthic community consisting of largebodied, deep-burrowing organisms; head-down deposit-feeding is characterized by deep sediment oxidation and the presence of feeding voids at depth; Entries such as ""1 on 3"" indicate that organisms emblematic of multiple successional stages-e.g., -stages 1 and 3--were present.","","","","",""

"change8808","Benthic habitat change trends for 1988-2008 were assigned by comparing the Successional Stage descriptors for those time periods. Trends indicate that the biotope changed and/or there was evidence of higher successional stage. Improved: Any portion of the 2018 Successional Stage descriptor is higher than in 2008. Remained good quality: The highest portion of the Successional Stage descriptor present in 2008 is still present in 2018 (e.g., a change from Stage 2 on 3 to Stage 1 on 3). Remained poor quality: A Successional Stage less than 2 is present in both years. Declined: Any portion of the 2018 Successional Stage descriptor is lower than in 2008 AND the 2018 Successional Stage is below 2. Change status not determined: Change status was not determined if there was insufficient information.","","","","",""

"arpd08","The depth of the apparent redox potential discontinuity (aRPD) in 2008, or the change in sediment color from oxidized (reddish/brown/tan) to reduced (black). The aRPD depth represents the recent history of bottom-water oxygen concentrations and bioturbation/irrigation. In Narragansett Bay, the aRPD depth is responsive to oxygen concentrations between 14-28 days prior to image collection. The maximum aRPD depth of any station replicate was used to represent the station.
