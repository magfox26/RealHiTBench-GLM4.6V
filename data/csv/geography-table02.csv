"1ARF regions in Florida are defined as: 1: Northwest, 2: North, 3: North Central, 4: South Central, 5: Central Everglades, 6: Lower East Coast, 7: Lower West Coast and Everglades National Park.","","","","","","","",""
"2ARFs were developed based on the PRISM gridded precipitation dataset for Florida. Areas correspond to aggregation levels of 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, 11x11 and 13x13 PRISM grid cells. For reference, MACA-Metdata grid cells are ~18.9 km2, LOCA and MACA-Livneh grid cells are ~42.9 km2, CORDEX NAM-22i grid cells are ~686.4 km2, and CORDEX NAM-44i grid cells are ~2745.8 km2. It is assumed that there is not a large difference in annual maxima at the station- (point-) and PRISM grid-cell scale. Therefore, an ARF of 1.0 is assumed at the scale of a PRISM grid cell.","","","","","","","",""
