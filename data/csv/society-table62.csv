"2 For any particular quarter, seasonally adjusted figures for self employed and other bankruptcies will not sum to the seasonally adjusted figure for total bankruptcies.

"3 Changes have been made to the part of the database used to capture information on trading status and industry codes.  From 2006 Q4, ""self-employed"" includes the categories ""self-employed""; ""trader but failure not as a result of trading"" and ""trading partnership""; and ""other individuals"" includes ""non-trading""; ""non-surrender"" and ""unknown"".  The breakdown by self-employment status from Q4 2006 should not therefore be considered to be entirely consistent with that for the earlier period.","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
