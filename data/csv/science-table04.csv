"","In this section, we have provided the conversion factors for some commonly used units. 
If the unit you want to use is missing, you can add it at the bottom of the table; in that case carefully check the sources of the multiplier factor. Remember to also add a proper named range to the new unit.

The base unit selected are: 
- Second for Time
- Joule for Energy
- Watt for Power
- Meter for Length
- m2 for Area
- Kilo for Mass","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
