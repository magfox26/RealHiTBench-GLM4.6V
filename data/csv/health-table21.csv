"NOTE: Disease-based price indexes measure the total amount paid (or total expenditures) to treat a specific condition, including changes in the underlying services used for treatment which are sensitive to changes in utilization or the mix of services for a treatment of a condition.  This is unlike traditional price index measures where a change in price relates to changes in the average price of a fixed basket of goods and services.  In the academic literature, the disease-based price is often referred to as a medical care expenditure (MCE) index (e.g., Berndt et al (2000) and Aizcorbe and Nestoriak (2010)) or the cost per case (e.g., Thorpe (2004) and Roehrig and Rousseau (2009)).
