"","NOTE: Local area indexes are byproducts of the national CPI program.  Each local index has a smaller sample size than the national index and is, therefore, subject to substantially more sampling and other measurement error.  As a result, local area indexes show greater volatility than the national index, although their long-term trends are similar.  Therefore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics strongly urges users to consider adopting the national average CPI for use in their escalator clauses.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
