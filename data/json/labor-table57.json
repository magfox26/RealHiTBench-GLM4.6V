Information about historical comparability is online at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#comp. As of 2003, estimates for the race groups shown (White, Black or African American, and Asian) include people who selected that race group only; people who selected more than one race group are not included. Prior to 2003, people who reported more than one race were included in the group they identified as the main race. Asian data for 2000–2002 are for Asians and Pacific Islanders. As of 2003, Asians constitute a separate category. Data for Asians were not tabulated prior to 2000. People of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity may be of any race; estimates for the race groups include Hispanics. The Consumer Price Index research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) is used to convert current dollars to constant (inflation-adjusted) dollars. See the technical notes section.
