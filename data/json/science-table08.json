The results from this survey were published by Shumchenia and King (2019). ": "Infaunal successional stage provides an additional way to characterize benthic communities, and can be used as a modifying metric to accompany benthic biotope descriptors. Successional stage designation relies on the assumption that in fine-grained benthic biotopes a predictable 4-stage sequence of benthic community types develops following disturbance (e.g., hypoxia/anoxia, dredging, etc.). Successional stage was assigned for each 1988 image based on the organism-sediment relationships visible in each image. (0 = Stage 0: Immediately following disturbance; no macrofauna visible; if oxygen and/or organic enrichment are major stressors, black reduced sediment will be visible at sediment-water interface; 1 = Stage 1: Characterized by “pioneer” species such as very small polychaetes, usually densely populated at or near the sediment-water interface; 2 = Stage 2: Ampelisca is a hallmark organism of this stage in Northeast US coastal systems; burrowing organisms are also present; 3 = Stage 3: Considered a mature benthic community consisting of largebodied, deep-burrowing organisms; head-down deposit-feeding is characterized by deep sediment oxidation and the presence of feeding voids at depth; Entries such as \"1 on 3\" indicate that organisms emblematic of multiple successional stages-e.g., -stages 1 and 3--were present."
